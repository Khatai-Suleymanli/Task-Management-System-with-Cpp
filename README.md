# Task Management System

This project is a simple **Task Management System** implemented in C++. It allows users to manage tasks through a command-line interface (CLI). The system provides functionalities for task creation, deletion, status updates, categorization, priority settings, and more. Tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence, allowing the system to retain tasks even after restarting the program.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Users can add new tasks with a name, category (e.g., Work, Personal), priority (Low, Medium, High), and a due date.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can delete tasks by specifying the task name.
- **Task Status**: Tasks can be marked as Pending, Completed, or Overdue.
- **Task Categories**: Tasks can be organized under different categories like Work, Personal, etc.
- **Priorities**: Tasks can be assigned priority levels (Low, Medium, High).
- **Due Dates**: Users can set deadlines for each task.
- **Task Storage**: Tasks are saved in a JSON file (`tasks.json`), so they persist between program runs.
- **Task Sorting**: Users can sort tasks by priority or deadline.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for tasks by keywords in the task name or category.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The entire system runs in the command-line interface.

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the project, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- The [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library for JSON handling. You can add this as a header file (`json.hpp`).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `task_manager.cpp` file to your local machine.
2. Download the JSON library from [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases) and place the `json.hpp` file in your project directory.
3. Compile the program with your preferred C++ compiler.

#### Example using g++:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 task_manager.cpp -o task_manager
```

4. Run the compiled program:

```bash
./task_manager
```

### Usage

Once you run the program, you'll be presented with a menu of options:

```
Task Management System Menu:
1. Add Task
2. Delete Task
3. Update Task Status
4. List All Tasks
5. Search Task
6. Sort Tasks by Deadline
7. Sort Tasks by Priority
8. Exit
```

#### Add Task

Input the task details when prompted: task name, category, priority, and due date (YYYY-MM-DD format).

#### Delete Task

Specify the task name to delete it.

#### Update Task Status

Specify the task name and choose the new status: Pending, Completed, or Overdue.

#### List All Tasks

Lists all current tasks along with their details.

#### Search Task

Search for tasks by entering a keyword (this will search in both the task name and category).

#### Sort Tasks

Choose to sort tasks by deadline or by priority.

#### Exit

Exits the program.

### File Handling

- All tasks are saved to a file called `tasks.json`. This file is automatically created and updated each time a task is added, deleted, or modified.
- When the program starts, it will load tasks from the `tasks.json` file.

#### Example Task JSON Structure

Hereâ€™s an example of how tasks are saved in `tasks.json`:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Finish report",
        "category": "Work",
        "priority": "High",
        "dueDate": "2024-09-15",
        "status": "Pending"
    },
    {
        "name": "Grocery shopping",
        "category": "Personal",
        "priority": "Medium",
        "dueDate": "2024-09-17",
        "status": "Pending"
    }
]
```

### Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements to the system:

- Add notifications or reminders for overdue tasks.
- Support for recurring tasks.
- Implementing a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
- Support for filtering tasks based on different criteria (category, priority, status).
